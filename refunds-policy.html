<p><strong>Refund Policy</strong></p>
<p>You agree to pay fees for the right to use the Services at the current rates set forth on our app from time to time or as otherwise provided to you by Us. Fees are subject to change, and any changes will be provided on our app or as otherwise communicated to you by Us. It is your responsibility to remain informed about the current payment rates from time to time in respect of the Services. Unless otherwise agreed to by Us, all fees paid are non-refundable. The fees (and any other charges) relating to the Services will be payable by you in Bangladeshi Taka using mobile financial services, debits cards, credit cards, or other available payment methods. Your payment transactions will be executed by an appointed "Payment Gateway". The Payment Gateway is a separate entity that will collect your payment and forward it to the processing bank for further execution. The Payment Gateway will be responsible for executing all transactions with your bank or MFS provider. All information related to your MFS, Card/Bank Account will be exclusively dealt with by the Payment Gateway and the Bank. We will not ask for your payment information on our site nor do we retain your payment information. The use of your MFS, credit/debit card, or account to account transfer services is governed by the agreed terms and conditions between you and your bank. For any unsuccessful payment or other payment-related queries, you must contact your Card issuing Bank or the Bank in which you maintain your account. Once you confirm your payment, you will not be able to cancel your order. You agree that we are authorized to bill your account and charge your designated method of payment when payments are due, including any sales or other applicable tax that may be required. There can be a situation where some technical problems may occur which are completely unintentional and due to which your payment may be deducted but we may not receive confirmation and consequently delivery or activation of your desired service may be delayed.</p>
